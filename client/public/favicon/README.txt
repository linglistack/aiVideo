FAVICON REPLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

The current favicon.ico file in the public directory is still the React logo.
To complete the StoryScene AI branding, you need to:

1. Convert the storySceneIcon.svg file (now also in this directory as favicon.svg) to .ico format
2. Replace the existing favicon.ico in the client/public/ directory
3. Update any references in index.html if needed

Several online tools can convert SVG to ICO files with multiple sizes:
- https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
- https://www.favicon-generator.org/
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/

The favicon should use the "S" letter with the gradient colors (#25F4EE to #FE2C55)
on a black background as shown in the SVG design.

Once you have the new ICO file, replace /client/public/favicon.ico with your new file.
